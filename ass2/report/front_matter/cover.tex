\parbox{0.85\textwidth}{
   This assignment focused on implementing autonomous navigation and face detection on the robot designed in the last assignment. Robot navigation was implemented using ROS official 2D navigation framework for ROS1. A trained YOLOv5 model was deployed for enabling face detection. The robot was redesigned to accomodate the navigation framework and the face detection model. Simulation environment for testing navigation was constructed in Gazebo Classic. A human model which is an anime character was edited in Blender and spawned in the environment for testing the face detection funtionality.
